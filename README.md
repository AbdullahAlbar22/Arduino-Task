📌 README: 3 Push Buttons & 3 LEDs with Arduino
This project controls 3 LEDs with 3 push buttons using an Arduino Uno.
Each button toggles its own LED ON or OFF when pressed.

🔗 Connections
Buttons: Connected to Arduino digital pins (with pull-up or pull-down resistors).

LEDs: Connected to Arduino digital pins with resistors.

Power: Breadboard powered by Arduino 5V and GND.

⚙️ How It Works
Press a button → its LED turns ON or OFF.

Each LED works independently.

🚀 Usage
Build the circuit on a breadboard.

Upload the Arduino code.
